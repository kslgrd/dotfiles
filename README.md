## A Fresh macOS Setup

These instructions are for when you've already set up your dotfiles. If you want to get started with your own dotfiles you can [find instructions below](#your-own-dotfiles).

### Before you re-install

First, go through the checklist below to make sure you didn't forget anything before you wipe your hard drive.

- Did you commit and push any changes/branches to your git repositories?
- Did you remember to save all important documents from non-iCloud directories?
- Did you save all of your work from apps which aren't synced through iCloud?
- Did you remember to export important data from your local database?

### Installing macOS cleanly

After going to our checklist above and making sure you backed everything up, we're going to cleanly install macOS with the latest release. Follow [this article](https://www.imore.com/how-do-clean-install-macos) to cleanly install the latest macOS version.

### Setting up your Mac

If you did all of the above you may now follow these install instructions to setup a new Mac.

1. Update macOS to the latest version with the App Store
2. Install Xcode from the App Store, open it and accept the license agreement
3. Install macOS Command Line Tools by running `xcode-select --install`
4. [Generate a new public and private SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and add them to Github
5. Clone this repo to `~/.dotfiles`
6. Run `fresh.sh` to start the installation
7. Restart your computer to finalize the process

Your Mac is now ready to use!

> Note: you can use a different location than `~/.dotfiles` if you want. Just make sure you also update the reference in the [`.zshrc`](./.zshrc) file.

## Your Own Dotfiles

If you want to start with your own dotfiles from this setup, it's pretty easy to do so. First of all you'll need to fork this repo. After that you can tweak it the way you want.

Go through the [`.macos`](./.macos) file and adjust the settings to your liking. You can find much more settings at [the original script by Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/master/.macos) and [Kevin Suttle's macOS Defaults project](https://github.com/kevinSuttle/MacOS-Defaults).

Check out the [`Brewfile`](./.config/brewfile/Brewfile) file and adjust the apps you want to install for your machine.

Check out the [`aliases.zsh`](./aliases.zsh) file and add your own aliases. 

You can tweak the [Starship shell theme](./.config/starship.toml) to your heart's content.

Enjoy your own Dotfiles!
